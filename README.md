# Turkish_Words_Dataset


This dataset contains all the Turkish words I've managed to fetch from the web. Dataset has over 6 million lines of Turkish word tokens, each seperated by "\n" so it is easier to read.

Some words are different variations of the same word e.g. "araba", "arabada", "arabadan". Feel free use lemmatization algorithms to reduce the data size.

I believe this dataset could be improved upon. It certainly is not finished. I will update this dataset if I can get my hands on new words in the future.

Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't allow us to upload files to our repositories if the file is larger than 25MB so I am not able to publish my dataset here. But you can still download the dataset from this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enistuna/all-turkish-words-dataset
